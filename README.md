# ðŸ›’ Maven Market Analysis Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of a **Power BI course**, where I worked as a **Business Intelligence Analyst** for **Maven Market**, a multinational grocery chain with locations in **Canada**, **Mexico**, and the **United States**.  

The goal was to transform a set of **raw CSV files** into a fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** to help management track store, product, and customer performance, and uncover business opportunities.  

**Note:** This was a practice project completed during the Power BI course.

The only data provided was a **folder of raw CSV files** containing:
- Stores  
- Products  
- Customers  
- Regions  
- Transactions  
- Calendar

## ðŸ“‚ Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Connection & Transformation**  
   - Imported multiple CSV files into Power BI  
   - Cleaned and shaped the data using Power Query  
   - Standardized formats for dates, currencies, and categories  

2. **Data Modeling**
